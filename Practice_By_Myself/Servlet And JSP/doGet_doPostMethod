 
	Servlet is the java file which takes the request from client on the internet and it can process that request and provide response in the format of “HTML” page.
Web-Container :- 
have Apache Tomcat/Glass Fish/WebShere
“TOMCAT” send request to servlet to get that “HTML” file but Servlet is “.java” file

In Short :-
•	Client send request to server(for dynamic page request)
•	Server goes to the web container which uses web.xml file to give response in html format to client.
HTTP Protocol Methods :
We have 7 methods but normally we used 5 methods :
1.	Get :- fetch data from server
2.	Post :- send / submit data to the server
3.	Delete
4.	Options
5.	Put
•	By default we used GetRequest method in our Addition project
Main difference between Get and Post method is :
When we use get method
<form action="addition" method="get">
We get URL like :
http://localhost:8081/ServletFirstProjectAddition/addition?number1=1&number2=2
we can able to see what data we passed for execution

When we use post method
<form action="addition" method="post">
We get URL like :
http://localhost:8081/ServletFirstProjectAddition
we are not able to see what data we passed for execution.
It helps us to hide our data.
AdditionServlet.java
public class AddServlet extends HttpServlet
{
	public void service(HttpServletRequest request,HttpServletResponse response) 
	{
		
	}
}
Except service() method we can use doGet()or doPost()method which is a part of public void service method.
Without service method we cannot use Servlet.
